# Project Description
### Project  Title
H4U

### Platform
Android
### Minimum and target SDK
5.0

### Description

The H4U app helps a user search for hospitals, pharmacies and doctors including; doctor details, doctor availability and doctor reputation. It will also show the directions to each hospital by showing the route map. The route map will be set from a user’s current location and will show both a visual and descriptive way of the route, which will make it easy for a user to find the hospital location.

# Sprint Log
Write one log per sprint.

## Commitment
List the features/stories the team commits to finish during the sprint.

## Reflections
Reflect on how the work worked.

Discuss any deviations from the sprint commitment.

For each practice practiced:

- Did your experience correspond to or contradict with what literature claims?

    - Analysis of why. Mostly interesting if something unexpected happens, but even
      if everything runs according to plan, reflecting on the underlying mechanisms
      can be interesting.

- How efficient was the practice, given the time it took to use?



# Postmortem
Once the project is finished, summarize your experiences.

- For each practice, reflect on the combined experience from all sprints.

- Which practices had the most impact on the software developed?
  Think of both positives and negatives.

- What would you do differently in a future but similar project?

- Outcome, screenshots or similar.

## Administrative details

- Send in the sprint reports and postmortem report via mail
  to Terese and Magnus. Deadlines are in the course schedule.

- The postmortem part shall be 2000-3000 words long.
