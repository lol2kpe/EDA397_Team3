# Project Description
### Project  Title
H4U

### Platform
Android
### Minimum and target SDK
5.0

### Description

The H4U app helps a user search for hospitals, pharmacies and doctors including; doctor details, doctor availability and doctor reputation. It will also show the directions to each hospital by showing the route map. The route map will be set from a user’s current location and will show both a visual and descriptive way of the route, which will make it easy for a user to find the hospital location.

# Sprint Log
Write one log per sprint.

## Commitment
List the features/stories the team commits to finish during the sprint.

## Reflections
Brainstorming was used to gather ideas for the project proposal. After getting the proposal accepted, the same method was used to gather ideas for functionality, these ideas were then formulated into user stories. Another brainstorming session was performed to decompose the most important user stories into tasks.

The 100$ method was used to prioritize the user stories according to relevance to
the applications goals. The results of the prioritization can be seen in Figure 1. It was interesting to see how unaligned our estimates were except for those that clearly contributed to the goal.

Pair programming was used to solve challenging tasks and worked really well in the group, both in the start of the sprint and the end of the sprint. It was used to solve for example fetching data from the database, integrating data with filter and integrating the map with the rest of the functionality.  

Testing worked quite good for specific methods however for Android GUI parts it was more challenging. When it came to test-first it was really good when you got used to it but it is also something that we need to work on the next sprint. Sometimes you started writing the functions without writing tests first because you are so used to that kind of programming. 

Refactoring was used to improve the code and make it more readable. It is really good to always consider refactoring the code since there is almost always something to improve. 

We definitely would have liked more time for the planning phase of the project. Within the short span of time that was given from the group formation to the delivery of Sprint 1 only gave enough time to gather the most important tasks and delegate them before starting to implement them. Methods we would have liked to use during the planning phase in the next sprint:
Analyze dependencies
Planning poker to estimate work
Software architectural design


# Postmortem
Once the project is finished, summarize your experiences.

- For each practice, reflect on the combined experience from all sprints.

- Which practices had the most impact on the software developed?
  Think of both positives and negatives.

- What would you do differently in a future but similar project?

- Outcome, screenshots or similar.

## Administrative details

- Send in the sprint reports and postmortem report via mail
  to Terese and Magnus. Deadlines are in the course schedule.

- The postmortem part shall be 2000-3000 words long.
