This is a basic template for the project report. Fill it out over the course of the project.

# Project Description
Write a brief description of your software,
including the target platform(s),
programming language,
and what the software will do.

# Sprint Log
Write one log per sprint.

## Commitment
List the features/stories the team commits to finish during the sprint.

## Work Done
Log what was accomplished, and how.

Feature | Commits  | Group members | Effort | Practices
----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------
Name and ID of each feature | Sha1 for the commit(s) that make up the feature | Names of the group members who developed the feature | The development effort expended, in story points or other unit of choice | The agile practices practiced when developing the feature


## Reflections
Reflect on how the work worked.

Discuss any deviations from the sprint commitment.

For each practice practiced:

- Did your experience correspond to or contradict with what literature claims?

    - Analysis of why. Mostly interesting if something unexpected happens, but even
      if everything runs according to plan, reflecting on the underlying mechanisms
      can be interesting.

- How efficient was the practice, given the time it took to use?



# Postmortem
Once the project is finished, summarize your experiences.

- For each practice, reflect on the combined experience from all sprints.

- Which practices had the most impact on the software developed?
  Think of both positives and negatives.

- What would you do differently in a future but similar project?

- Outcome, screenshots or similar.

## Administrative details

- Send in the sprint reports and postmortem report via mail
  to Terese and Magnus. Deadlines are in the course schedule.

- The postmortem part shall be 2000-3000 words long.
